# Phylogenetic Analysis Using Python
## What is a Phylogenetic Tree?

*  A branching diagram.
*  Showing the inferred evolutionary relationships among various biological species.
*  Based upon similarities and differences in in their physical or genetic characteristics.
*  Each node with progenies represents the inferred most recent common ancestor of the progenies. 

## Types of Phylogenetic Tree

* Rooted Tree
    Most commonly the root is referred to as an â€œoutgroup"

* Unrooted Tree
    Make inference about the most common ancestor of the leaves or branches of the tree.

## Data

All Genetic sequences are taken from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).
The sequence used here is for [Influenza A virus of Taiwanese Goose](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KT388705.1).
