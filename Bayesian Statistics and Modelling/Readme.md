## What is Chemical Kinetics?

It is a part of chemical science that deals with Rate of chemical reactions and factor which effect the reaction rates.

## Ordinary Differential Equation

A differential equation is an equation that defines a relationship 
between a function and one or more derivatives of that function.
For example, this is a differential equation that relates the function y(t) with its first and second derivative.

### Implicit and Explicit ODEs

An explicit solution is any solution that is given in the form y=y(t). In other words, the only place that y shows up is once on the left side and only raised to the first power , which is not explicit is known as implicit solution.

## Stoichiometric matrix :

A stoichiometry matrix is an M-by-R matrix, where M equals the total number of species in a model, and R equals the total number of reactions in a model. Each row corresponds to a species, and each column corresponds to a reaction.

## Steady State Analysis :

The steady state is the state in which the state variables of the model, e.g. the species concentrations do not change in time. Mathematically this is expressed by setting the differential equations that describe the time evolution of the metabolic system to zero. This forms a system of algebraic non-linear equations.

## Metabolic Control Analysis

Metabolic control analysis (MCA) is a mathematical framework for describing metabolics, signalling and genetics pathways. MCA quantifies how variables, such as fluxes and species concentrations, depend on networks parameters. It can describe how network dependent properties, called control coefficients, depend on local properties called elasticity. The elasticity of a function is a constant alpha if and only if the function has the form f(x) = C*x^alpha for constant C > 0.
